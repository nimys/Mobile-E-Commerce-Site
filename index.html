                <li>Thread count is often referred to with a number like 50s, 80s, 100s, 120s, 140s 160s, etc up to 200s.</li> 
                <li>Rather, these numbers refer to the yarn size.</li> 
                <li>140s means there are 140 hanks (1 hank = 840 yards) of yarn in one pound.</li>
                <li>Regardless, 140s fabric has a higher thread count than 120s and 160s fabric has a higher thread count than 140s and so on.</li> If you ask us what the threadcount of a fabric is, we will probably tell you something like “140s” because that number is easy to understand even if it’s not a literal measure of threadcount.

    		<h2>FORMAL SHIRTS</h2>
			<h3>About formal shirts</h3>
			<ul>
            	<li>A high quality traditional shirt has long tails, extending almost to the knees at the back, and so has seven or eight buttons.</li> 
				<li>The vertical strip of fabric running down the front opening is called the placket, and gives a more symmetrical appearance to the joint between the left side, on top, and the right.</li>
				<li>This left over right order is also seen in waistcoat and coat fastenings, though women's clothing buttons the other way (right over left).</li> 
				<li>The buttonholes, aligned vertically, are placed on the placket, though the top button and buttons at the bottom of stiff fronts are aligned horizontally.</li>
				<li>The buttonholes are one of the few places where the difference between hand and machine stitching can be observed while the shirt is being worn, and fashion designers sometimes use contrasting thread here or on the buttons themselves for extra impact.</li>
               <li>To give extra fullness to the back, there are often pleats where the back panel joins to the yoke.</li> 
			   <li>On some fittings these are not needed, and handmade shirts may feature the extra fabric being worked continuously into the seam.</li> 
			   <li>In America, a box pleat is common (two pleats together in the centre), while in Britain the pleats are placed wider out under the shoulders.</li>

    		<h2>CASUAL SHIRTS</h2>
			<h3>About casual shirts</h3>
			<ul>
            	<li>The intended use of shirts dictates different choices of pattern.</li>
				<li>For example, country shirts are usually checked, with checks of different size to co-ordinate with tweeds of different pattern, and featuring one, two, or sometimes more colours of check over a light cream or white background.</li> 
				<li>For city shirts, plain or striped designs are more common, most stripes being vertical, while horizontal stripes are a legitimate option.</li> 
				<li>Herringbone patterns are worn informally and casually.</li> 
				<li>Some colours, such as purple or pink, are generally only worn with city shirts.</li> 
				<li>Further, the use of colour is seasonal, with shades like green being associated more with autumn than summer ones like yellow.</li> 
				<li>Colours and patterns may be chosen for more than simply aesthetic reasons, as trends such as power dressing (first noted in Molloy, Dress for Success [1975]) emphasise the social impact of clothing. For example, a City executive might stereotypically wear strong vertical patterns for meetings to emphasise his authority.</li>

			<h4>ABOUT RAYMOND GROUP</h4>
			<img src="images/logo.png"/>

<p>The Raymond Group was incorporated in 1925 and within a span of a few years, transformed from being an Indian textile major to a global conglomerate.<br>

In our endeavor to keep nurturing quality and leadership, we always choose the path untaken - from being the first in 1959 to introduce a polywool blend in India to creating the world's finest suiting fabric the Super 250s made from the superfine 11.4 micron wool.

Today, the Raymond group is vertically and horizontally integrated to provide customers total textile solutions. Few companies globally have such a diverse product range of nearly 20,000 varieties of worsted suiting to cater to customers across age groups, occasions and styles.

We manufacture for the world the finest fabrics - from wool to wool-blended worsted suiting to specialty ring denims as well as high value shirting.

After making a mark in textiles, Raymond forayed into garmenting through highly successful ventures like Silver Spark Apparel Ltd., EverBlue Apparel Ltd. (Jeanswear) and Celebrations Apparel Ltd. (Shirts).

We also have some of the most highly respected fabric and apparel brands in our portfolio: Raymond, Raymond (Ready-To-Wear), Park Avenue, ColorPlus, Parx, Makers and Notting Hill.

The Raymond Group also has an expansive retail presence established through the exclusive chain of 'The Raymond Shop' and stand-alone brand stores.

We are today one of the largest players in fabrics, designer wear, denim, cosmetics & toiletries, engineering files & tools, prophylactics and air charter services in national and international markets. All our plants are ISO certified, leveraging on cutting-edge technology that adheres to the highest quality parameters while also being environment friendly.</p>
